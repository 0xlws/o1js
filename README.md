# snarkyJS

snarkyJS is a Typescript/Javascript framework for writing zk-SNARKs and snapps.

It allows you to construct zk-SNARK circuits in Typescript and run the prover and verifier in the browser (via wasm) or on a server (via Rust).

snarkyJS is very much a work in progress. Examples on here may be incomplete, and APIs may change completely over the next few months.

If you would like to provide feedback, develop using snarkyJS, or beta-test it, please get in touch via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vjgVPu1XtxYYpE7d07Wga_nObWKwshsExJY7F4NQOaM).
