### Added

- Implement the [precondition RFC](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/179#issuecomment-1139413831):
  - new fields `this.account` and `this.network` on both `SmartContract` and `Party`
  - `this.<account|network>.<property>.get()` to use on-chain values in a circuit, e.g. account balance or block height
  - `this.<account|network>.<property>.{assertEqual, assertBetween, assertNothing}()` to constrain what values to allow for these
- `CircuitString`, a snark-compatible string type with methods like `.append()` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/155
- `bool.assertTrue()`, `bool.assertFalse()` as convenient aliases for existing functionality
- `Ledger.verifyPartyProof` which can check if a proof on a transaction is valid https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/208
- Memo field in APIs like `Mina.transaction` to attach arbitrary messages https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/244
- This changelog

### Changed

- Huge snark performance improvements (2-10x) for most zkApps https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11053
- Performance improvements in node with > 4 CPUs, for all snarks https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11292
- Substantial reduction of snarkyjs' size https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11166

### Removed

- Unused functions `call` and `callUnproved`, which were embryonic versions of what is now the `transaction` API to call smart contract methods
- Some unimplemented fields on `SmartContract`

### Fixed

- zkApp proving on web https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/226
